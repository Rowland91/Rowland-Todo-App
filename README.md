## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* (Remove item code was implemented with N0 ERRORS BUT FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT SUCCESSFUL) causing additonal time to be spent trying to resolve functional issue before moving forward. Issue was resolved via Tech Fellow help.

* Updated to latest SDK & HAXM Version(s), but emulater still runs extremely slow making testing and running the code less productive due to efficiency constraints.
